# Todo app

A simple todo app that lets users add tasks, mark them as complete, or remove them from the in-progress section

## Description

This project was built using React, JavaScript, Flexbox, and Node.js. During this project, I had difficulties using the .map() and .filter() methods to handle adding the tasks, and marking tasks as completed. However, after reviewing my approach, I was able to see how they work, which helped solidify my understanding.

## Features

This app allows users to:

- Add tasks using the input field.
- Mark tasks as complete which moves that task to the completed section and clears it from the in-progress section.
- Clear tasks from both the in-progress and completed sections.

In the future, I wish to implement additional features such as a priority option.

## Why this was built

I built this project as a portfolio piece and to also help strengthen my knowledge of state management, the .map() method, and the .filter() method.

## Getting started locally

3. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install`.
